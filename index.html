                <p>Curriculum Developer at Lead School- As a Curriculum Developer Intern at LEAD School, I collaborated with a dynamic team, learning the importance of timelines and the dedication required to stay current in a fast-paced environment. I gained valuable experience in utilizing AI integration, backend applications, and websites to develop educational content. My role involved creating books for CBSE and ICSE students, where I employed AI-driven tools for content development, prompting, and image generation. This internship not only honed my technical skills but also allowed me to build a strong network of professionals in the education technology sector.</p>

                    FROSH- 
                    From June to September 2024, I had the opportunity to work with Frosh, a society at Thapar University dedicated to easing the student counseling process. My role involved facilitating document verification, hostel allocation, and organizing daily events over a month to help new students transition from school to independent college life. Through this experience, I honed my event management skills, learned the intricacies of event creation and backend coordination, and worked collaboratively with a team of around 80 people. This journey also contributed to my personal growth, as I transitioned from being reserved to engaging more confidently with others. Additionally, I developed skills in lead generation, marketing fundamentals, and managing outreach relationships.
